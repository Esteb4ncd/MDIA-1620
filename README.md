 3 AHA moments:
 - "md" stands for mark down
 - Paradigm is a style or way of programming
 - ";" is used to conclude lines in JavaScript
  ---  
 2 things that are still unclear:

 
-  How to commit my code (i know how to do it, but it is not 100% clear of how it works yet)
-  is there a way to have a kind of "auto save" for github? i uderstand why for group projects it would be a bad idea, I"m just curious.

3 things I am confused about:
 1. If i have an array within an array... to target it, is it " ${horseNames[1[2]]} "?
 2. I'd like to lean more about how to format my code in the most readable way possible
 3. Does "====" exist?


 3 things i have a solid understanding of:
 1. how booleans work
 2. How to use "else" and "if"
